# OPEN AI GUI

I am currently developing a state-of-the-art, user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) application using the powerful Python GUI framework, Tkinter, in conjunction with a custom Tkinter module. The application is a text-based conversational AI, designed to provide an intuitive and seamless experience for the end-user. The user is prompted to input text into a text button, and the application utilizes the cutting-edge technology of OpenAI's GPT-3 model to generate a highly accurate and natural response. This integration of advanced AI technology with a sleek and user-friendly GUI design makes for a truly impressive and professional application
